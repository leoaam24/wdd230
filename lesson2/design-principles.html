        <h3 class="card-info">Fiverr</h3>

        <p class="card-comment">On this page, the principle described in Fitts' Law is apparent through the green search button visible at the top of the page. The main purpose of the website is to allow users to search for services they need or that others need. With this goal in mind, the green search button serves as a convenient way to accomplish the site's goal. As a result, people can easily navigate and find what they are looking for on this website.</p>

        <h3 class="principle-name"><b>White Space and Clean Design</b></h3>
        <h3 class="card-info">AMD</h3>
        <p class="card-info"><a href="https://www.amd.com/">amd.com</a></p>
        <img src="images/white-space.png" alt="webpage-amd-portion">
        <p class="card-comment">In this example, we can see how the design utilizes white space. Each item is given space to emphasize its distinct role on the page. For instance, the product sample and the description of its revolutionary characteristics are given ample space. Additionally, we can observe that the action button is given enough space to be emphasized.</p>

    <section id="design-card-3">
        <h3 class="principle-name"><b>Proximity</b></h3>
        <h3 class="card-info">Go High Level</h3>
        <p class="card-info"><a href="https://www.gohighlevel.com/">gohighlevel.com</a></p>
        <img src="images/proximity.png" alt="webpage-gohighlevel-portion">
        <p class="card-comment">In this page, we can see an example of how the principle of proximity was applied. The text 'Watch Demo' is closely placed right above the video object to show its content. The blue boxes containing the statistics are also closely spaced together to indicate that the numbers given are relative to each other. These boxes complement the message above them, which indicates how the platform would help the user.</p>
